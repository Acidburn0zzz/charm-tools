==================

This is a collection of Ensemble formulas for use as a reference and in
deploying real services using ensemble. See Ensemble's home page for
more information.

Directory structure:

scripts/
  tools to help in building and testing formulas

templates/
  templates for usage in building new formulas

formulas/
  This directory is now empty, as formulas are now controlled by the 'principia'
  distribution at https://launchpad.net/principia. Formulas will now be assumed
  to be in $PRINCIPIA_HOME or under the current working directory if it is unset.

In order to use any of these formulas, once you have ensemble setup and
working in your path:

$ ensemble deploy --repository=$PRINCIPIA_HOME mysql

Will deploy the mysql formula.

formulate
====
To generate a new formula from a debian package available on your system

$ scripts/formulate foo

This should add a directory to formulas with the name foo, and some of the metadata.yml and hooks filled in. It will create these in $PRINCIPIA_HOME or under the current working directory.

proof
====
To perform basic static analysis on a formula, run

$ scripts/proof foo

It will analyze the formula for any obvious mistakes.
